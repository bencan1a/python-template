📘 Project: Automated Doc Management System for Solo Developer + Agents

Purpose

We want to set up a simple but reliable doc management system so that all documentation for this project stays coherent and automatically up to date.
The system will support both permanent docs and ephemeral agent work, allowing agents to collaborate safely without creating drift or clutter.

Folder Model and Rules

You must respect these folder purposes:

Folder	Purpose	Persistence	Rules
agent-tmp/	Scratch / debug / intermediates	Ephemeral (gitignored)	Agents may freely create or delete temporary files. Nothing here is committed.
agent-plans/<project>/	Ephemeral plan docs for refactors, experiments, migrations, etc.	Short-lived	Each plan has its own subfolder and a plan.md file with required metadata.
docs/	Permanent, canonical documentation for the codebase	Persistent	This is the single source of truth. Agents must prefer this folder when writing long-term docs.

Required Files and Structure

/agent-tmp/                 # scratch (gitignored)
/agent-plans/               # ephemeral plans
/docs/
  CONTEXT.md                # main generated context for agents
  SUMMARY.md                # quick index for agent navigation
  facts.json                # stable, hand-maintained truths
  CHANGELOG.md
  _generated/               # generated references (API, schemas, active plan summaries)
/tools/
  build_context.py          # script that assembles all docs
/.github/workflows/
  docs.yml                  # GitHub Action for nightly + push builds
AGENT_DOCS_CONTRACT.md      # human/agent-readable folder rules
.gitignore

Plan File Specification

Each agent-plans/<project>/plan.md must begin with the following fields:

status: active|paused|done
owner: <name>
created: YYYY-MM-DD
summary:
  - short bullet
  - another bullet

Notes
	•	Only status: active plans less than 21 days old will be summarized into docs/_generated/plans_index.md.
	•	Old or completed plans are ignored but remain in history.

⸻

Automation Behavior

A GitHub Action (.github/workflows/docs.yml) will:
	1.	Run on pushes that change source, schema, or docs files, and every night.
	2.	Execute tools/build_context.py to:
	•	Regenerate API docs (Python via pdoc3, TS via typedoc).
	•	Summarize active plans.
	•	Merge everything into docs/CONTEXT.md (capped ~150 kB).
	•	Update SUMMARY.md and append an entry to CHANGELOG.md.
	•	Prune agent-tmp/ files older than a week.
	3.	Auto-commit updated docs directly to the repo (no manual approval required).

Environment defaults:

CONTEXT_MAX_CHARS: "150000"
PLANS_MAX_AGE_DAYS: "21"
CLEAN_TMP_AGE_DAYS: "7"

Agent Operating Rules

Reading
	•	Primary context: docs/CONTEXT.md
	•	Trust order:
1️⃣ docs/facts.json → 2️⃣ permanent docs/ content → 3️⃣ Active Plans summaries
	•	Treat “Active Plans” as hints only; permanent docs override them.

Writing
	•	Permanent knowledge: write or update files under docs/.
	•	Ephemeral tasks or refactors: write to agent-plans/<project>/.
	•	Never commit anything under agent-tmp/.
	•	Always include required metadata fields in plan files.

Updating
	•	The nightly Action will refresh the docs automatically.
	•	Manual run: execute python tools/build_context.py.
	•	Each refresh updates CHANGELOG.md and stamps source_sha in generated files.

⸻

Outputs for Agents to Reference
	•	docs/CONTEXT.md → single canonical context file.
	•	docs/_generated/ → sub-components (API, schemas, plans).
	•	docs/SUMMARY.md → list of components and update timestamp.
	•	docs/CHANGELOG.md → chronological record of doc rebuilds.

⸻

Implementation Checklist
	1.	Create the folder structure exactly as shown.
	2.	Copy in AGENT_DOCS_CONTRACT.md, .gitignore, build_context.py, and docs.yml.
	3.	Install pdoc3 (pip install pdoc3) and optionally typedoc (npm i -g typedoc typedoc-plugin-markdown).
	4.	Commit everything.
	5.	Verify the workflow runs successfully on the next commit.

⸻

Success Criteria
	•	Running python tools/build_context.py locally produces updated docs/CONTEXT.md with correct front-matter (source_sha, provenance).
	•	GitHub nightly action auto-commits doc updates if any changes occur.
	•	Agents writing plans see them appear in docs/_generated/plans_index.md within 24 h.

⸻

Goal:
Create a self-healing documentation loop where agents always operate from up-to-date context, permanent docs stay consistent with code, and ephemeral plan content decays naturally without polluting long-term knowledge.

✅ End of agent prompt. Implement exactly as described.
